Note->
I have not deployed the application to any cloud provider like AWS, Azure, google cloud etc., as this are paid cloud providers. Vercel can host the frontend, but Django backend cannot run on Vercel natively. Google Gemini AI integration requires a valid API key, the valid api key is in .env file
